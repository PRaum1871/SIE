 GER_the_second_scramble_for_africa:0 "The Second Scramble for Africa"
 GER_the_second_scramble_for_africa_desc:0 "Africa has long since been a very important hub for every power of Europe, either due to tactically beneficial areas like the Suez canal, or the vast amount of resources ripe to be plucked from the ground. Predictably, these advantages provided by the dark continent have not gone unnoticed by the Reichsfuhrer, who has seen the value in it, especially given what he has heard in regards to Belgian endeavours in the Congo. Naturally for this it has provided an excellent opportunity for the rising Germanic empire to reap those same rewards, though it's still up for debate on how exactly this is to be accomplished."
 GER_let_the_industrialists_take_over:0 "Let the Industrialists Take Over"
 GER_let_the_industrialists_take_over_desc:0 "Following the traditional plan for large swaths of territory, several Reichskommissariats will be established to divide the conquered territories and provide an ease of administration to the greater Reich, while this may mean that, in some cases, large native resistance will be had, it will be dealt with over time as the Reich stabilises into a much more stable state, free from the resource influence of other nations and allowing the Empire to achieve true economic and resource Autarky."
 GER_settle_the_land_for_germans:0 "Settle the Land for Germans"    
 GER_settle_the_land_for_germans_desc:0 "With the African wilderness tamed we have been provided with two options. The Reichsfuhrer has chosen the latter, forming an industrial board from the largest companies the Weltreich has to offer and putting them in charge of Africa as a whole in order to rend the most resources they can for the good German citizens, of course some colonisation will take place but that will only be for the purpose of establishing a local force to govern to the territories, which will likely be divided up between the corporations as they deem fit. /n Some have claimed that while this will certainly provide all the resources the Reich will need to function, it will end up ruining the pricing on European and native German resources. Not that it matters, as long as the Reich has the materials to build itself into an Empire which will take the Aryan race the naysayers may say as long as as they wish."
