 POLITICS_CALVIN_MALLARD_DESC:0 "Calvin Rudolf Mallard, a controversial leader, seen as a benevolent revolutionary by some and a genocidal tyrant to others. Born in April 11, 1883, in Bonn, Prussia, he was the son of a Prussian aristocrat and his English mother. Aspired to be an economist and attended the University of Munich in 1901. At age 25 he moved to England where he worked on many British newspapers and even as a financial advisor for businesses. Like many men of his time, he began to take interest in politics during the great war, but it was not until his career was ruined due to his homosexuality being exposed that Mallard truly became radicalised into his ideas. Mallard, who believed that the discrimination suffered by homosexuals to be a great injustice, he saw it as an elaborate conspiracy to empower wealthy homophobes and destroy the homosexuals of Europe. After being exposed, Mallard made sure that his sexuality was public, seeing it as not only natural but, something to be proud of. Some joined his cause, while others scuffed at him for his absurd ideas. He would form the Same's Liberation Front in 1922, as a homosexual activist group to push for homosexual rights. But, the movement was met with criticism and ridicule, even being labelled as a terrorist group. Even with the growing popularity of his group, the accusations against Mallard were constant, such polemic beliefs would lead to the Downing Street Massacre of 1923 when, during one of Mallard's demonstrations, the British military opened fire on his crowd. It was only then that Mallard began support the use of violence for his cause, he would form the Freedom Fighters for Same's Rights, the FFSR. During this time the group's ideology was officially coined, Sameism, the homonationalist ideology that believed homosexuals are not only natural but also superior to the heterosexual, believing in a caste system with homosexuals as the elite and the heterosexuals as the peasantry. The FFSR steadily growth in popularity made Mallard the target of many assassination attempts, which only strengthened his discourse. When the British Civil War broke out in 1930 Mallard at first allied himself with the right, fighting on the side of the nationalists and fiercely condemning the anarchists who murdered the British royal family. Despite his ideological divergences with the other nationalists, his popularity and strong leadership granted him immense influence and power, which he used to take power in 1935, when Britain was changed forever. His early reign was as violent and chaotic and the civil war that proceeded it, yet despite the odds, his regime survived for decades, by 1945 the newly renamed Greater Britannia was an stable regional power, his rule was prosperous, with his name being a source of inspiration to homosexuals around the word, that was until 1958."
 POLITICS_ROSENBERG_DESC:0 "Born in 1893, in the Russian Governorate of Estonia, Rosenberg came from a background of wealth, his father being a wealthy merchant from the city of Reval. A young Rosenberg graduated from the Petri-Realschule, soon moving onto the Riga Polytechnical Institute to study architecture and engineering at Moscow’s Higher Imperial Technical School. Though, during the German occupation of estonia in 1918 Rosenberg found himself serving as a teacher at the Gustav Adolf Gymnasium, where, that very same year, he’d give his first speech on Jewish Marxism, two days after the estonian war of independence, the outbreak of which would prompt Rosenberg to emigrate into Germany. Contrary to expectations, Rosenberg was able to find himself able to make connections with the state’s bureaucracy and soon place himself amongst its numbers. Though this is where the story truly begins. One would not be remiss for disregarding former deputy Volksfuhrer Alfred Rosenberg, after all most within the party who aren't aligned with him would consider him a betrayal of what Strasser had hoped to achieve. With his Volkist ideology, or what many have colloquially referred to as ‘Rosenberg Thought’, being dismissed as rabid nationalism which disregarded Marxist ideology for ideas of corporatist economic ideals, pan-Germanic nationalism and Ethno-supremacism. Though in all this upon his ascension to the Führership he wept tears for Strasser, it was a tragedy how the former Volksfuhrer died so suddenly, not that Rosenberg would know anything about it."
 POLITICS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Calvin Mallard has died. Despite this, Britannia and, Sameism will continue, now in the hands of the Council of the Trusted, Mallard's inner circle, cabinet and upper house of Britannia. The Council had made an agreement to preserve the unity of Britannia, in fear of heterosexuals overthrowing them from a civil war. Despite that, the Council has internal factions of a few men in the council who seek to change the country's future. Reformists, Orthodoxists, Hardliners, Evolutionists are at eachother's throats about who will succeed, regardless of Calvin Mallard's last order of chosing his successor from his death bed. Some of the members already made alliances of who would take over, and there would be a lot of fighting but, rarely bloodshed. The public will not know what will go down behind closed doors. But one things for sure, Britannia isn't going to be the same after Mallard's death."
