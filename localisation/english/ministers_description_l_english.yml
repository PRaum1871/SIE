After the putsch was foiled, she would lay low as Churchill fled from Britain from the failure of the putsch. Her party would start to fall apart as she was usurped by Oswald Mosely becoming a prominent fascist in Britain. Around that time, she would begin to read of the works of Calvin Mallard after her lover, Mary Sophia Allen. She would later join in Mallard's FFSR rallies and, would later met Calvin Mallard in person. He would be close friends with her, and would agree to having the British Fascists merge with the FFSR, which caused many of them to leave to join Mosely, with some members rallying to Mallard for his ideology and, them being homosexual themselves. She was dependent on drugs and alcohol but, would later kick the habit as she would become a devout Sameist, even participate in the British Civil War in 1930, with her rallying many other women to Mallard's side. As an award for her loyalty and contributions, Mallard would appoint her Foreign Secretary after his proclamation of the United Republics of Greater Britannia in 1935. She would also marry Mary Sophia Allen around that time. She would also lead the Women's wing of the FFSR by strengthening their position in Britannia. While she had ambitions for potentially succeeding Mallard, but would later endorse William Mordell as he became a likely favorite of Mallard for his work.  Orman would remain a prominent figure within the conservative wing of the FFSR. There was rumors of her having affair with Mallard or Mordell outside of Britannia but, this was denied as a way to delegitimize her and, the rumor was brushed off as an heterosexual ploy. Regardless Lintorn-Orman would be one of Mallard's most loyal cabinet members."
