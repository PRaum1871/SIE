 ENG_onto_important_matters:0 "Onto Important Matters"
 ENG_onto_important_matters_desc:0 "It's fucking over and done with. Finally, Those bastards in the Mediterranean have backed off, no matter what we had to do to make them. This conflict of interest has distracted us for far too long, we have much more pressing matters to attend to. Although righteous in its ideology, our government is still... 'ambiguous' about a few details of our governance. It is time to decide how to keep this doomsday clock of a nation ticking in order to ensure that we can move on freely and finally take our aspirations. Mallard is not a fool, he knows he may not live to see the rise of the empire he has constructed in his heart and mind, but he will make sure that the utopia we are building will not be built on foundations of Sand. It is time to see if he will make the right calls." 
 ENG_looking_westward:0 "Looking Westward"
 ENG_looking_westward_desc:0 "Much to the displeasure of Mallard and many of our more hawkish party members, the detente we are currently engaged in with the USA may be one of the only factors guaranteeing our survival. As such, the factions in the FFSR that are much more experienced with foreign relations have cooked up contrasting plans to deal with them. It is difficult times that we live in, and it would be an incredible display of ignorance to plunge our government into even more troubles. There will be a day when the United States sees the rise of Sameism, but as of current, it is best that we remain pragmatic."
 ENG_call_turing:0 "Call Turing"
 ENG_call_turing_desc:0 "Turing. That old pain in the ass. A reformer by trade, Turing has been called the savior of Sameism by some and a dissident by others. He and his faction have seemingly carefully built up a plan that would have us seek a better relationship with the USA through business agreements, active diplomacy and even included plans to support progressive groups in the USA. Although a bold move, Mallard appears to have taken great interest in the old code-breakers newest scheme and has given orders to the Bureau of Foreign Relations to begin dictating Turing's ideas as the official detente policy. Many are apprehensive to the idea, including Mallard himself according to some reports, but even he knows that changing the machine is sometimes better than greasing up the cogs."
 ENG_detente_with_the_LFW:0 "Detente with the LFW"
 ENG_detente_with_the_LFW_desc:0 " The Global Coalition of Democratic Nations. What a joke. What's democratic about it? Our people remain oppressed and kept from their rightful place at the top of the food chain. Still, there is value in making peace with some elements of their establishment. This part of the plan has left many conservative members of the FFSR begrudged and disgruntled, but it is necessary. Mallard has given an order that the head of the BFR, Rotha linton Orman is to meet the LFW in two conferences in London and Washington D.C to finalize a detente treaty with the LFW. She is expected to act diligently in pursuing a stable peace, regardless of her own beliefs about the more liberal approach we are taking."
 ENG_a_visit_to_london:0 "A visit to London"
 ENG_a_visit_to_london_desc:0 "Mallard and Orman have organised a feast in honour of the leaders of the quote "Free World" and to negotiate the first terms of the "North Atlantic Peace Association". The "NAPA" treaty plan has been decried by conservatives, warhawks and even some reformers for seemingly attempting to undermine and disregard the views of the administration for the sake of a fake peace. Turing is likely to attend this conference, and will seek to ensure that his views are fully incoporated in the ratification of this treaty. However, it is likely that Mallard will not allow many liberal reforms to the detente both countries are enthralled in, as this will only be a temporary truce to allow the Brittannic Republic to continue its agenda to its fullest ability. Riot police march up and down the streets, the heterosexuals have been forcibly removed from the streets surrounding Westminster and Downing Street, and the remaining minorities have been chased back to their slums. So begins the first conference."
 ENG_a_visit_to_washington:0 "A Visit to Washington"
 ENG_a_visit_to_washington_desc:0 "Those FUCKING LIBERALS! that conference was a sham. Turing is an intelligent man, and Mallard has never been wrong in the way he has led us. But that conference took way too much diplomacy for many of our ill-tempered bereaucrats. It was expected that there would be an air of tension, but a god damn screaming match? In westminster itself? this was an unacceptable display of incompetence, and it will not be tolerated. Those smug bastards from across the Atlantic forced a compromise for every single issue and even those fucking opposites tried to usurp our rule by rioting. They deserved every fucking bullet that hit them. This was a travesty. But, we cannot see this as a complete loss. Peace is a long road that we must trudge down, even if we have to take the most conservative members of society down it kicking and screaming. The propaganda posters preach the success of the conference and a sigh of relief is breathed by the common homosexuals of Britain. Now Orman has been summoned to Washington D.C to negotiate the final signing of the treaty. Long live Mallard! Bringer of Peace! Herald of the Homosexual Revolution!"
 ENG_offer_immigration_from_the_usa:0 "Offer Immigration from the United States"
 ENG_offer_immigration_from_the_usa_desc:0 "Although Turing's plan for Detente has support from Mallard himself, many Conservative and Old Guard members of the FFSR have struggled to cope with a few of the plans more liberal elements. As such, it currently seems best that we 'ease' those discontented party members into this more liberal detente before implementing some of the more radical elements. Therefore, Immigration, although a controversial topic among many party members, could be the place to start. Besides, What could go wrong? offering Immigration to the USA could be a way to show some new faces the glory of Sameism."
 ENG_invite_american_businesses:0 "Invite American Businesses"
 ENG_invite_american_businesses_desc:0 "As Intellectuals, Academics and Philosophers, we here in the party understand the evils of economics, but we are not blind to the fact that 'Money makes the world go round'. Although an unintelligent and rowdy mob, the Americans have a somewhat good track record when it comes to Business. It only makes sense that inviting American Businesses to Britannia would be a mutually beneficial agreement. However, regardless of what President Mallard has decided to pursue in terms of economic policy, inviting the so-called 'Oligarchs of American Capitalism' that our media has sought to demonise will be a highly controversial choice. We run the risk of upsetting not just the party itself, but the fanatics our propaganda has raised to hate the American Business we now seek to co-operate with. We must tread carefully."
 ENG_quietly_support_civil_rights_movement:0 "Quietly support Civil Rights Movement"
 ENG_quietly_support_civil_rights_movement_desc:0 "It's all been leading up to this. The most radical idea that our establishment would allow us to pursue with extreme caution. The decision to support Civil Rights movements in America is seen as quite possibly the greatest contrast in policy in our nations history. Most members of our party dislike one kind of minority, if not all of them. As such, pouring funds into and making quiet under-the-table deals with a progressive Minority rights group is an incredibly odd idea. Many conservatives fear that this could set a dangerous new precedent in our party, and fervently disapprove of the idea. Even Mallard is going to take some convincing, as he grows more and more dissaproving of Turings Plan in private. This could either tear the party apart, or give us a way to influence foreign progressive politicians, either way, Turing isn't going to get this idea through the party bureacracy easily."
 ENG_dial_mordell:0 "Dial Mordell"
 ENG_dial_mordell_desc:0 "Mordell. That cockteasing roach. Sometimes Mallard wishes that he wasn't surrounded by a group of bureaucrats and yes-men, and remembers the days when he was a young man surrounded by his fellow homosexual revolutionaries, all comrades in a beautiful uprising against the status quo. Those days were long gone now. Although depicted as an incompetent yes man by many of his adversaries, the majority of the party sees Mordell as the heir apparent to Mallard. As such, his allies have almost deified his new attempt at diplomacy. Almost subservsive in many of its details, Mordell seems to want a much more conservative approach at foreign relations. Further guarantees of independence to our sphere, infiltration of progressive groups and small diplomatic conferences to keep that beast at bay should be more than enough to grease up the gears of our diplomatic machine."
