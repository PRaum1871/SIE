 maoism:0 "Maoism"
 maoism_desc:0 "Maoism, also called Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, is a variant of Marxism which, using the teachings and experiences from other socialist experiments, specially the works of Lenin and Mao Zedong. It seeks to create a version of Marxism adapted to the material and social conditions of the modern world. Because not every region on the planet is the same, it is very common for Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to be adapted to regional differences, such as Marxism-Leninism-Maoism-Gonzalo Thought in Peru or Marxism-Leninism-Maoism-Prachanda Path in Nepal."
 marxism:0 "Marxism"
 marxism_desc:0 "Developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels Marxism is an ideology which covers both social and economic aspects of society by analyzing it through the lens of Historical Materialism, Class Conflict and Scientific Communism. The core of Marxism lays in its criticism of capitalism, seeing the bourgeoisie social class, the owners of the means of production, as having fundamentally opposite views from the Proletariat class, being an obstacle to the path towards communism, a classless society in which all property is communally-owned, therefore, the only way for the Proletariat class to achieve liberation and to reach communism would be trough violent revolution and class warfare. Since the inception of Marxism, there has been countless schools of thought derived from it, most Marxists describe themselves with additional adjectives, such as Marxists-Leninists or describe themselves as following the theory of new, more modern communist thinkers, such as Maoists or Leninists, with the sole label of “Marxists” being used sometimes by classical, or Orthodox Marxists."
 leninism:0 "Leninism"
 leninism_desc:0 "Leninism is nothing more than Marxism adapted to the social conditions of 20th century Russia, with Lenin himself rejecting the idea of a Leninism separate from Marxism, whomever, the works of Lenin where accepted by many Marxists for their universality, which transcended Russia. Leninism puts increased emphasis in the concept of the Vanguard Party, a communist party built and supported by the proletariat to guide the country into the path towards Socialism and Communism, rejecting Syndicalism and trade-union struggle, Democratic Socialism, on which free speech  and debate were allowed until consensus was reached, wherein the all the party members had to abide to what was agreed, and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, the state power effectively in the hands of the proletarians, which exercise democracy thought the Soviets, which are elected worker councils."
 titoism:0 "Titoism"
 titoism_desc:0 "Titoism is, simply put, the ideology of Croatian revolutionary leader Josip Broz Tito. Born from the rejection of Russian communism and other foreign influences, its main values lay in Nationalism instead of pure internationalism, organizational self-management for the workers, non-alignment to major powers and an economy based on Market Socialism, defending the cooperative ownership of the means of productions on the framework of a Market Economy."
 trotskyism:0 "Trotskyism"
 trotskyism_desc:0 "Trotskyism is an ideology developed by Leon Trotsky, and it’s the major current school of thought derived from Leninism. Born from the split in the Bolshevik movement after the death of Lenin, it won the power struggle against both the self described “Center”, which advocated for the doctrine of Socialism in one country and the “Right”, which advocated for the continuation of the New Economic Policy and which opposed the Five Year plans and collectivization. Trotskyism, the self described “Left”, defended the concept of Permanent Revolution as opposed to Socialism in One Country, believing that the socialist state should immediately kickstart revolutions around the globe to begin a constant armed struggle against the capitalist powers, Trotskyism also believes in the immediate transition to Socialism, rejecting transitional states, and also believed that only the proletariat, not the peasantry, was fit to lead the revolution towards communism, being tasked with empowering and emancipating the peasantry when in power."
 ho_chi_minh_tough:0 "Ho Chi Minh Though"
 ho_chi_minh_tough_desc:0 "Ho Chi Minh Thought refers to the ideology of revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh and the communist party of Vietnam, self described as Marxism-Leninism adapted to the material conditions of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh Thought has Maoism at its core, rejecting the superiority of the proletariat over the peasantry, seeing the peasant as the true revolutionary vanguard. Ho Chi Minh also defended the development of the state-owned economic sector to create the material basis for the development of socialism, which he describe as the unity of agricultural, industrial and intellectual workers under the leadership of the communist party. Besides economic and social policies, Ho Chi Minh Thought puts great emphasis in morality, using what Ho Chi Minh saw as the best aspects of Christianity, Buddhism and Confucianism, seeing the values of integrity and selflessness in the servitude of the people, living a life free of material worries while devoting oneself to serving the collective good and the advancement of socialism and self determination."

 baathism:0 "Ba'athism"
 baathism_desc:0 "Ba'athism is a socialist ideology developed in Iraq and Syria, which seeks to achieve the ideals of Arab liberation, self-determination and unification, following the tenets of Pan-Arabism, Arab Socialism and the Vanguard Party. Ba'athists believe that the people should be under the protection of a revolutionary vanguard party, which must be secular and progressive, that is because Ba'athists believe that the failure of the Arab Revolt in achieving arab unification was because it was led by a Reactionary Class, that is, the monarchy, which saw the unification of Arabs not as a necessity to achieve self determination and to achieve a cultural renaissance, but only saw Arabs as subjects, seeking to overthrow the Ottoman imperialists so that they themselves could reign."
 syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a labour movement current which advocates for the formation of trade unions, which would organize the workers in order to achieve socialist reforms trought strikes. With the limit of peacefull and legal means to achieve socialism, the global syndicalist movement began to decline in the late 1930's. Today, the syndicalist movement lives on and anarcho-syndicalism, which believes that the anarchist society will be attained trough the abolition of wage slavery and worker self management, aswell as National-Syndicalism, which flourished under the French and Spanish States."

Based on his beliefs, Turingism or Sameism with Turing Characteristics still adheres to Mallardist thought but, with the scientific racism excluded, and not being chauvistic. He pushes for more of a state for all homosexuals to make Britannia, a home for all homosexuals, regardless of background, and making it be part of the international world instead of destroying it like Sameism, wether that is more out of outliving the world is unclear. His ideology is often based more on the futurist and technocratic side, of pushing for the future and science instead of, the reactionary thoughts of Mallard."
 sameism_ideology:0 "Sameism"
 sameism_ideology_desc:0 "Sameism or Mallardism as it's sometimes called, is an homo-nationalist ideology created by former British economist Calvin Mallard and his psychologist husband Dr. Edward Charleston. The ideology is based on the premise of the world being organised by a what is called by Mallard a "natural order", a caste system where homosexuals are the intellectuals and the elite while heterosexuals are the peasantry and the breeders. Inspired by Fascism, Marxism, Futurism and the homosexual movements of the 1920s. Sameism pushes for homosexual supremacy, scientific racism, totalitarianism, ultranationalism, anti-capitalism and socialism. It is sometimes regarded as a variant of Fascism but many argue against it due to its many differences."

Being born after Sameism seizing power of Britain in 1935, it pushes for scientific advancements to eradicate heterosexuality, by making reproduction being done either asexually or homosexuality to make heterosexuality obsolete. The movement has been met with a lot of criticism for being inaccurate and "Anti-Sameist" but Charlestonites would disagree and believe it to be Sameism at it's natural conclusion thus, being considered the most extreme sect of Sameism."
 queer_populism:0 "Queer Populism"
 queer_populism_desc:0 "Queer Populism, while it adheres to Mallardist worldview, it's often more focused on homosexual interests instead of supremacy, or Homonationalism. They are often sympathetic to democracy, however they would often appease to the homosexual populaton or, push for their interest more than others. Often they don't condemn Sameism compared to ones who are often Anti-Sameists. Queer Populism would push for homonormality, and homosexuals rights for all. However, it remains mostly Mallardistic based on the principles of abolishing heteronormality, homosexuals ruling over society in history and, homosexuality being intergal to culture."
 homonationalism:0 "Homonationalism"
 homonationalism_desc:0 "Mallard's beliefs would change the very identity of what it means to be homosexual, but there has been many ideas of how to implement it, or how it is. Homonationalism is an ideology that pushes for homonormality instead of supremacy, it would often make homosexuals be more of a class instead of a caste. They are still very nationalistic and authoritarian, it isn't as totalitarian as Sameism but, is often regarded to being close to Sameism, with heterosexuals being more or less second class citizens or segregated."

Spartan Sameism or Stratocratic Sameism believes that homosexual societies are inherently militaristic and ultranationalist. They would push for a more Spartanistic lifestyle, with luxuries being an exception with a few differences, and all homosexuals to be prepared and grown up as soldiers with heterosexuals caring for the youth. They are often jingoistic, Darwinistic and, extremely totalitarian. It is considered one of the most extreme ideologies derived from Sameism."
 clerical_sameism:0 "Clerical Sameism"
 clerical_sameism_desc:0 "Mallard's view on religion is very strongly negative, seeing it as part of the "pillars of decadence". However, there has been Sameists who disagree on that idea. Alfred "Bosie" Douglas, Rupert MacCullough and others believe that Sameism and religion are compatible due to of the spirituality of homosexuality tied to the customs of the church and, it's connection to God. Clerical Sameism pushes for a state ruled with the clergy from the Christian churches with the "Natural Order" from Mallardist thought. It pushes for the idea of homosexuals as God's blessed people, with many heterosexuals, other races and, beliefs as heretics. Heterosexuals who are considered "blessed" by God would considered the givers of children. Other ideas push for Adelphopoiesis, strict opposition of hedonism for purity, fundamentalism, and ethnic cleansing."

The main characteristic of Rosenberg Thought is pan-Germanic nationalism, alongside a belief of Germanic supremacy, based upon Rosenberg's own racial theory which places pure blooded Germans as the master race, with Baltic Germans like himself placed not too far beneath them. To further serve the Aryan race is a concept of living space or 'Lebensraum' in which the master race must carve land and tame their inferiors in service of the master race. Where Rosenberg Thought shines most, and is possibly its most confusing, is its religious stance, Rosenberg Thought asserts that the German nation must follow a religious doctrine of Neo-Paganism."
