But we don't have to, Rosenberg has already performed a series of private speeches and interviews where he has denounced the 'reactionary barbarism' that Strasser had initiated in order to give people the untold truth about the former Fuhrer. /n Of course we'll have the non-believers, but in a time of desperation..."
